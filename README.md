# Sample used cars prices prediction for Vietnamese market


The repo that contains all the source code and obtained data for the used cars prices prediction model for Vietnamese market

The global used cars market was estimated at $828.24 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $1,355.15 billion
by 2027. In Vietnam, Used Car market in terms of sales volume increased at a double digit CAGR over the review period
2013-2018. The market was observed to be at the early growth stage owing to the faster vehicle replacement rate,
reduction in new car launch time, growing middle class population, increasing average ticket size and reduction in
import duty on new cars. In Vietnam, people prefer to buy a used car as new ones are expensive and for middle or lower
income group people, used cars have become more popular choices. Vietnamese government is expecting new policies that
ban motorbikes in the urban area so that the demand for used cars is expected to rocket.

Due to the increasing demand for used cars in Vietnam, we have built a prediction model to predict used cars' prices
to make it easier for Vietnamese to purchase cars.
